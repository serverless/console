# @serverless/aws-lambda-otel-extension

## AWS Lambda extension that gathers [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) data and sends it to the Serverless Console ingestion servers

_Package is still in an experimental stage and subject to major changes._

_At this point, only Node.js runtime is supported, but this support will be extended in the near future_

### How does it work?

The extension is a lambda layer with a source maintained in [opt](opt) folder. There are two extensions configured within a layer:

1. External, placed in [opt/otel-extension/external](opt/otel-extension/external) folder, which gathers information (from (1) execution environment (2) AWS Lambdas APIs (3) Data provided via internal extension) and sends the compliant [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) payload to Serverless Console ingestion servers
2. Internal, placed in [opt/otel-extension/internal](opt/otel-extension/internal) folder, which is pre-run in the same process as Node.js Lambda handler, and through pre-setup instrumentation gathers additional data about invocations, which is sent to external extension

### What telemetry payload does it generate?

_TODO: This section will be completed in the near future_

### How to configure AWS Lambda to use it?

#### 1. Build layer artifact

##### 1.2 Node.js runtime version (external + internal extension)

_Note: pre-build layer artifacts are published to our AWS accounts, and instead of building it manually (as documented below) it is advised to rely on them instead (for ARN's of the pre-published layers check registry files which are attached to GitHub releases)_

```sh
# Ensure layer dependencies are installed
cd external/otel-extension-external
npm install
cd ../../internal/otel-extension-internal-node
npm install

# Build artifact
cd ../../
npm run build
```

Artifact is generated into `dist/extension.zip` file

##### 1.3 Runtime agnostic version (just external extension)

Runtime agnostic version (of just external layer) can be built as following

```sh
# Ensure layer dependencies are installed
cd external/otel-extension-external
npm install

# Build artifact
cd ../../
npm run build:external
```

Artifact is generated into `dist/extension-external.zip` file

##### 1.4 Custom settings

Monitoring settings (as documented below) can also be bundled into generated layers, for that pass path to settings file with `--settings-filename` param. File is expected to be a valid Node.js CJS module, It can be plain JSON, or JS, which can be helpful in case of dynamically resolved settings

```sh
npm run build -- --settings-filename <path>
```

#### 2. Publish layer

Publish layer artifact to your AWS account

#### 3. Attach layer to target Lambda and configure necessary environment variables

Ensure that layer version ARN is listed in Lambda layers.

Ensure that internal extension of a layer is pre-loaded by configuring `AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER` environment variable with `/opt/otel-extension-internal-node/exec-wrapper.sh`

#### 4. Configure monitoring settings

Monitoring settings are expected to be provided in JSON format at `SLS_EXTENSION` environment variable.

##### Required settings:

###### `orgId`

Serverless Console organization id

###### `namespace`

Namespace at which reports should be grouped (Serverless Framework sets it with _service name_)

###### `environment`

Application environment (Serverless Framework sets with _stage_ value)

###### `ingestToken`

Serverless Console ingestion token, to be obtained via Serverless Console API. At this point it's resolved automatically in context of the Serverless Framework (manual resolution instructions will be provided in a near future)

##### Optional settings:

##### `logs`

Settings that affect log monitoring. Supported options:

- `logs.disabled` - Set to true to disable logs monitoring

##### `request`

Settings that affect requests monitoring. Supported options:

- `request.disabled` - Set to true to disable requests monitoring

##### `response`

Settings that affect response monitoring. Supported options:

- `response.disabled` - Set to true to disable response monitoring

### Generated reports structure

_TODO: Complete documentation on generated telemetry reports is in the works_

#### Response reports

Any non JSON objects in either a simple response or a HTTP response payload are not included

For example, the following will be sent without any modifications ðŸ‘‡

```json
{ "message": "lambda response" }
```

```json
{ "statusCode": 200, "body": "{\"message\": \"lambda response\"}" }
```

The following responses will be altered

_Simple non JSON object responses will be ignored_

| Input             | Output    |
| ----------------- | --------- |
| "Lambda response" | _Ignored_ |
| true              | _Ignored_ |
| 12                | _Ignored_ |

_HTTP Responses with a non JSON body will be ignored_

| Input                                              | Output                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `{ "statusCode": 200, "body": "lambda response" }` | `{ "statusCode": 200 }` |

### Tests

Tests can only be run in context of package repository (they're not included with npm package).

See [Tests documentation](./test/README.md)
