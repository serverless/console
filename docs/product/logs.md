# Logs
In Serverless Console logs
are automatically collected by the [Serverless Console Extension](../platform/extension.md)
and can be viewed in two ways.

## Real Time Logging in Dev Mode
Logs are often the first step when troubleshooting your
Serverless Application. This is where using Dev Mode can
be especially helpful. Dev Mode provides logs  from your 
application(s) streamed to Serverless Console in less than 
a second in an aggregated view. This is accomplished
by establishing a web socket connection to Serverless Console
which then forwards the logs to your web browser. 

Note: Due to bandwidth limits you may be forced to set a filter
in order to stream logs. 

## Trace Logs
Logs are also especially useful when troubleshooting specific
errors. When you find an invocation that results in an error
and click on the Trace, you can find details about the exection
under the Logs section of the Trace Detail view. 

## Disabling log collection
You can disable log collection on your service by setting the
following property. 

```yaml
org: myorg
console: 
    logs:
        disable: true
service: myservice
frameworkVersion: '3'
```

## Log Formatting
Log content such as JSON is formatted for display when possible. We
also hide some log meta-data that is generated by the 
Serverless Console Extension[../platform/extension.md] but is not useful to you. 
Because of this you may notice some small differences in log content if you
are comparing logs in Console to another log storage tool.
