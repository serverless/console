# Getting Started
Welcome to Serveless Console. 

The next generation monitoring tool for Teams 
building with Serverless architectures. The easiest way 
to get started with Serverless Console is using the 
latest version of Serverless Framework (v3.7.5+ required).

```text
npm install -g serverless
```

You can configure an existing project with 
Serverless by adding `--console` flag the serverless command. 

```text
serverless --console
```

This will set the following in your Serverless project. 

```yaml
dashboard: true
console: true
org: ahevenor
service: aws-node-project

frameworkVersion: '3'
```

**Note:** If you are using Serveless Dashboard features be sure to keep
the dashboard property set to true. This will give you access to existing
dashboard features like Providers. 

**Setting up a new project from a template**
To start with a new example project, just run the following where
you want to create your project.

```text
serverless --console
```

This will begin an interactive onboarding experience, which creates
your first Serverless Framwork project.
