# Serverless Console Guide

Serverless Console provides everything Developers need to *build*, *operate* and *observe* unprecedented amounts of logic on the cloudâ€”**themselves**.

To do this, Console combines development and observability features into a single, elegant solution.  It's designed to keep open as you build your initial application, and handle all monitoring and debugging needs when you're in production.  It does this via curated metric views, innovative troubleshooting features, real-time streaming logs, and more.  It can also forward metrics, logs, traces and more via the OpenTelemetry data format to other monitoring solutions, to help you integrate Console into your organization.

Serverless Console specializes in serverless functions (e.g. AWS Lambda), containers (e.g. AWS Fargate) and infrastructure (e.g. AWS Kinesis) on Amazon Web Services.  It's not a solution for AWS EC2.  Console focuses on next-generation cloud infrastructure to empower the next generation of companies, teams and developers.

This guide shows you how to set up and use Serverless Console.
