# Serverless Console for AWS Lambda

Serverless Console is optimized to work with AWS Lambda, and has planned integration
for further AWS Service integration. This guide provides instructions
for, [configuring credentials](setting-up-creds.md), [instrumentating AWS Lambda functions](extension.md) 
and [supported frameworks](frameworks.md).

## Runtime Support
We're working to expand our runtime support. 
On AWS Lambda we currently only support Node.js.

### Node.js
Node.js is the only supported runtime for instrumenting with Serverless Console.

### Python
Pyhton support is coming soon!
