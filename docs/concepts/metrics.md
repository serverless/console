## Metrics & Metric Definitions
Metrics about your Trace are also collrected and stored in
Serverless Console for alerting and charting. These metrics
are stored individually on each trace as well as sampled for
storage and alerting purposes.  

We are expanding the list of metrics and currently support the 
following metrics for ingestion.

**FAAS Compute Duration** - This metric is used for collecting 
details about the total time it took for a given Trace which is 
used for calculating costs. 

**FAAS Memory Percent**  - This is the memory percentage 
used for a function invocation.
