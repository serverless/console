## Logs
We believe logs are a critical step for monitoring and troubleshooting
your Serverless Application. That said Serverless Runtime does not
yet collect logs. We do use information from our instrumentation
to link you into Cloudwatch to pull logs directly from your
AWS Console. 

We're hoping to improve this soon and encourage you to reach out
if you are interested in this feature.
