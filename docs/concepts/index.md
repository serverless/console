# Concepts 
Serverless Console is built on a simple set of observability 
concepts that work across all types of apps - no matter how 
they are built or managed. We built Console on the three pillars
of observability, [logs](logs.md), [metrics](metrics) and traces.

## Serverless Runtime
[Serverless Runtime](http://github.com/serverless/runtime) is a collection 
of [Open Telemetry](http://opentelemtry.io) collectors we use to automatically
instrument your application. The easiset way to get started with
Serveless Runtime is to get started with Serverless Framework or
visit [Serverless Runtime](http://github.com/serverless/runtime for
intsalling the collector in your Lambda function.
