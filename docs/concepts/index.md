# Concepts 
Serverless Console is built on simple abstractions that fit across all types of 
apps - no matter how itâ€™s built or managed. This is built on the [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) 
which focuses observability around standardizing the implementation of tracing. 
Traces occur when something triggers an event in your system, which causes your 
application to be invoked.  When you develop with Serverless Framework, 
or include your own Open Telemetry instrumentation we collect 
and display these traces so you can, chart, debug and alert on them.
