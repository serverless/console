# Using Console
Serverless Console provides an easy to use User Interface for 
monitoring your Serverless architectures. We automatically
recongize patterns by observing [Traces](traces.md) sent by our
[Serverless Runtime instrumentation](concepts/index.md).

## Getting Started
You'll need to start by instrumenting your workload. Check our
[getting started](../index.md) guide to deploy your first 
Open Telemetry instrumented app.

## Logging and adding Team members
You'll need to sign up or sign into Console. The login is
shared with Serverless Dashboard.
