# Overview
Serverless Console provides an easy to use User Interface for monitoring your
Serverless architectures. We automatically recongize patterns by observing
[Traces](traces.md) sent by our [Serverless Runtime instrumentation](../concepts/index.md).


To start using the Console to monitor your apps, you'll need to signup, and
create your own organization. 


**Setting up a new project from a template**
To start with a new example project, just run the following where you want to
create your project.

```text
serverless --console
```

This will begin an interactive onboarding experience, which creates your first
Serverless Framwork project.
