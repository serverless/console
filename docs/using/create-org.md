# Creating an Organization 

If you're new to Serveless, you'll need to sign up and create an Orginization
(Org) on [Serverless Dashboard](https://app.serverless.com) to start using
Serverless Console. An Organization is treated as a tenant across Serverless
products and data is not able to be shared across Organization.
