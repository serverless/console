# Integrations
Serverless Console has a growing list of supported integrations,
which include cloud providers such as AWS Lambda, as well as
communication and collaboration tools such as Github, and Slack.

This section provides an overview of our currently supported integrations.

# Serverless Console for AWS Lambda

Serverless Console is optimized to work with AWS Lambda, and has planned integration
for further AWS Service integration. This guide provides instructions
for [instrumenting AWS Lambda functions using the Serveless Console Extension](extension.md) 
and [details about supported frameworks](frameworks.md).

## Runtime Support
We're working to expand our runtime support. 
On AWS Lambda we currently only support Node.js.

### Node.js
Node.js is the only supported runtime for instrumenting with Serverless Console.

### Python
Pyhton support is coming soon!
